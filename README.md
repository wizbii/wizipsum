# wizipsum

We all have funny mates, right?

* [Demo Page](https://wizbii.github.io/wizipsum)
* [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wizipsum/ncibdpfgnoldfhagojkniefnaokacfhf)

*This is the demo page's readme. Have a look at the [master branch](https://github.com/wizbii/wizipsum) for the wizipsum npm package.*

## Add yours

By adding your own lorem ipsum, you're making it available and shareable on the demo page and usable through the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wizipsum/ncibdpfgnoldfhagojkniefnaokacfhf).
All you have to do is:

1. Add your data to the [src/data.json](https://github.com/wizbii/wizipsum/blob/gh-pages/public/data/wizbii.json) file
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`
4. Submit your pull request

When your contribution gets merged, you'll then be able to share it via, e.g: https://wizbii.github.io/wizipsum#yourdata

*If you want to speed up the process, you can also add your data to the [chrome-extension](https://github.com/wizbii/wizipsum/tree/chrome-extension) branch.*
